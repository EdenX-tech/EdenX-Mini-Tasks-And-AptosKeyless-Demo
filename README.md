# EdenX-Mini-Tasks-And-AptosKeyless-Demo

# This codebase is a demonstration version of the EDENX contract interaction functionality. 

# It showcases the creation of an Aptos wallet using AptosKeyless technology via a Google account, and implements features such as EdenX OAT minting and other platform tasks. 

# Currently, this functionality is provided as a demo and will be migrated and integrated into the EdenX Telegram mini program in the future.
